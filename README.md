The visualizations contained within this Github repository represent work in progress for my class titled, "PPOL 646: Data Visualization." They explore the relationship between poverty, race, and school quality in Maryland public schools using data from the Urban Institute. I use R to create baseline versions of the visualizations, which I further refine in Adobe illustrator. The edited versions can be found in the "Adobe illustrator edits" folder.
